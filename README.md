#Cinema Geolocation (with JS and JQuery)



Build a mobile app to find the closest cinema.

Iteration I: 
Create a Form with the name of the cinema, latitude and longitude. We want to keep that data even though we close the browser. Guess what you should use... it's not a (server-side) Database ;)

Iteration II:
Locate our position. Then look for the closest cinema. Check out this function for the distance.

Iteration III:
Show a Google Map centered on our position

Iteration IV:
Show a marker on the map at the closest Cinema

Extra: 
Show one marker for each of the other cinemas. Try to customize the markers, be creative!

Here you have an example on how to use Google Maps:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-simple
